        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          First, a rambling description of some of the technical details of a DZ
          custom cue. These details have varied only slightly over the years and
          are now considered my standard.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          Standard length is 58" with a joint diameter of .840" and a butt
          diameter of 1.270". The distance from the joint face to the wrap is
          usually 12.25" and the wrap is usually the same length. The standard
          buttcap material is Delrin or linen based phenolic.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          The joint screw I prefer is a modified 3/8-10 pin that uses a minor
          diameter of .308" - sometimes referred to as a 3/8-10 FB (flat bottom)
          pin. This pin has several advantages over the standard 3/8-10 pin.
          First, the minor diameter fits closely to the shaft. Thismayhelp with
          alignment but its main function is to tighten up the fit as compared
          to a 60° standard thread. Second, since the threads are slightly
          shallower, they machine much cleaner - again, promoting a close,
          accurate fit between the pin and the shaftwood. This translates to a
          very intimate connection between shaft & butt, giving you a better
          feel for what happens when your tip contacts the cueball.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          To further enhance this fit, I use live tooling to machine my internal
          shaft threads - in fact, most threads - rather than using a tap, which
          has a tendency to tear wood. Live tooling cuts exceptionally clean
          threads that more concentric than tapped threads and are full depth
          for maximum strength.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          My shafts are typically 13 mm and use Tomahawk, Elforyn or Juma
          ferrules. These materials can be capped or not and they can be any
          length you want. I have several other options available (see
          theRepairspage).
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          My std shaft taper grows 1/4 mm in the first 10" then grows smoothly
          from there. I have other tapers available, too. One is a longer pro
          taper that is available in 13 mm. There is also a stiffer taper that
          grows 1/2 mm in the first 10" and a jump/break shaft that is stiffer
          still.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          Joint collars are threaded on, as are ferrules. I use the same live
          tooling technology on these external threads, too. Some people use
          compression dies which merely raise a little bump that cannot compare
          to the strength & integrity of a live tooled thread.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          Any number of points can be installed in the forearm and/or the
          buttsleeve. Deep V-groove inlays with or without veneers are very
          popular. Some order butterfly points, floating points, inlays, boxes,
          etc. or any combination of the above.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          My standard joint trim is a simple 1/4" thick black linen collar on
          the shaft and behind the joint collar. This allows you to order a
          spare shaft with minimum downtime, should you decide you want one at a
          later date. This also makes adding an aftermarket shaft painless &
          less obvious. Of course, I can make virtually any type of custom trim
          ring if that is your preference. Of course, adding a spare shaft - or
          customizing an aftermarket shaft to match - will take more time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          Textured black calfskin leather is the standard wrap but Irish Linen
          is available, also. My personal preference is NO wrap - just a figured
          piece of wood. This can cost a bit more but I like being able to grip
          the cue very lightly and still have enough friction that I don't worry
          about launching a 58" missile across the table.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          I require 30% of the total price as a deposit to begin building your
          cue. If, for some reason, you change your mind about finishing your
          cue, I reserve the right to retain a portion of your deposit to cover
          my investment to that point. The amount retained can range between 50%
          and 100%, depending on the amount of personalization incorporated in
          your cue. It will take about 12 months to complete your cue & I'm
          proud to say most cues are done early.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          Below is a table that will give you a place to start when figuring the
          cost of a DZ cue. Keep in mind that this is only a starting point. I
          factor in many variables such as rarity of woods, exceptional figure,
          total number of inlays, etc. Some things raise the price & some lower
          it.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          One example: everybody wants AAA Grade Whatever wood in their cue. The
          knowledgeable shopper is aware that I can buy a blank of that wood for
          $30 so he expects me to charge accordingly. What he doesn't consider
          is that when I buy 24 pieces of the AAA Grade Whatever @ $30 each, I
          actually only receive maybe 3 pcs that qualify as true AAA Grade. The
          rest of the wood is nice...just not quite AAA. As such, I will charge
          much more for one of the true AAA pieces.

        <p className="text-md text-center font-medium break-words">
          A word about Sneaky Petes (SP): these are made from full spliced (FS)
          blanks from various manufacturers. The base FS cue is usually curapay
          or purpleheart into straight grain maple. These are choice blanks from
          a reputable maker. The points are shorter & the returns are large &
          squared off but the construction is solid. The mid level FS blank is
          made by Kelly Peterson ofMVP Cues. His points are much longer & the
          returns are small & tight. His construction is as good as it gets! Of
          course, these blanks are a bit more expensive but they are
          distinctive. The top level is a veneered FS blank from MVP. In my
          opinion, these are the best blanks available today. There are only a
          handful of people making these and, while their quality is generally
          quite good, I believe Kelly's work stands a level above everyone
          else's. His miters are flawless & the returns are usually under .020"
          wide. You can see a sample of a rough MVP blankHERE.
